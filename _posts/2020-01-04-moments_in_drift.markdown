I created the soundtrack for the "Moments in drift" projection mapping work by Janne Ahole. It was exhibited at City Hall of Helsinki during Lux Helsinki 2020 light festival.

Excerption from Lux Helsinki 2020 web site:

_Rut Bryk’s ceramic wall relief City in the Sun in the lobby of City Hall comes to life in a completely new way in Janne Ahola’s installation. Moments in drift is an abstract depiction of the changing of the seasons._

_“Video mapping creates a new layer by projecting an image that further highlights Bryk’s kinetic work.”_

_The installation runs on a loop without a beginning or end. It should be viewed as a painting or statue and not as linear video art. The sound design for the installation is by Tommi Toivonen._
