#### Client: Lume Games / 505 Games

I composed original music for the game and created all of the in-game sound effects (including character VO sounds). Post Mortem notes: It could have been much better and I feel that the lack of having a decent game audio engine (HH being a non-Unity / non-Unreal indie game) or middleware contributed to difficulties in audio asset management, game audio mixing and achieving smooth audio playback in various situations.
