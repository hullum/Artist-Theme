#### Client: Sanoma Games
I was responsible for creating the in-game sound effects, character VO assets and leading the game audio production process. I worked closely with the game music composer, VO talent and the development team to ensure that all audio was delivered and implemented on time. I also worked with the development team on audio scripting and integrating Master Audio middleware to Unity.
