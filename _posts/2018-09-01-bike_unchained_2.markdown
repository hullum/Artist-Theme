Bike Unchained 2 from Red Bull is the sequel to the #1 mountain bike game on mobile! Race against real riders in PvP Downhill action, or line up your best tricks in Slopestyle competitions.

I was responsible for the sound design and music editing of the game. I created all ingame audio assets for the game (including hundreds of bike and location sounds, transition and UI effects and jingles). During the project we did several indoor and outdoor field recording trips to record various bike and impact sounds heard in the game.

## Recording MTBs indoor

Sometimes we had to improvise and use unorthodox methods to get the job done...

... but the only thing that matters is that the audio sounds right!
