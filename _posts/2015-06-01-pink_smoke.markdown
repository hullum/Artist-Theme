##Pink Smoke
**Director: Sevgi Eker**

"The body of a young girl is found by a frozen bay. Three men, all accused of her murder, share their unique view of the story in an interrogation room. Three distinct subjective realities are displayed by the men, with time and place re-arranging and creating a different outcome."
