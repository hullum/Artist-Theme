"Nuanc3d is a powerful artwork at the crossroads between contemporary circus, media art and music. The performers' movement and media art based on sensor technology create a uniform, intensely visual world. Captured by the kinetic sensor, the performersâ€™ movement is reflected on the big screen as a real-time video image that creates a three-dimensional impression, in which reality and media art are brought together." - Stoa
