Anatude is a slot game developed by PAF Game Studio. It is based on Antti Tuisku, one of the most known popstars in Finland, and his fictional concert. I was responsible for the overall sound design and music editing. I created all the in-game / trailer sound assets that matched and played well with Antti Tuisku's music. 

If you want to try the game, you can play a free demo here:<br>
