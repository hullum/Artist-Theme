What happened when we added conductive dough, electronics, interface & sound design to the mix? Sounds From The Blop! 

It is a noisy 3-person multiplayer sound performance where you conduct electricity through play-dough that actually is electrically conductive! There's a small Arduino board hidden that reads the data and passes it over to Pure Data that mangles and warps sample playback (among other things) and kills your darling speakers while doing so.

I did the sound design, electronics and programming for the piece. We made the piece for Kiasma ARS17 hackathon.
