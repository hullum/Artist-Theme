#### AMBISONICS Sound Design

I created spatial ambisonics sound design for this Wärtsilä concept film about the Seabin trash collector. I used Reaper to sequence the sounds, FB360 for the ambisonics encoding, Audioease panners to spatialize the sounds and Ambi Limiter HD for mixing to a certain LUFS level.
