#### Client: Kuuasema / Rovio
I was responsible for creating new sound effects and background ambiences for the following Angry Birds Seasons expansions:

* - Summer Camp
* - Marie Hamtoinette
* - Fairy Hogmother
* - The Invasion of the Egg Snatchers

I also wrote and produced the theme song for the Fairy Hogmother expansion with Hanna Toivonen.
