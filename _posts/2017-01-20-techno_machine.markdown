#### A DIY user interface and step sequencer for Sonic Pi

Techno Machine is a simple synth app made with Sonic Pi and Processing. I was teaching a lot with Sonic Pi and Processing while working at <a href="http://www.mehackit.org">Mehackit</a> so we wanted to create a simple project that combines the best out of those two. That's how Techno Machine got started... 

It includes 4 drum channels, patterns and kits, a synth with two oscillators and really simple filter and amplitude controls. The most fun part of it is the 8-step note sequencer! Just hit randomize and create new note sequences on fly!

Do you want to try it? Sure thing, but you have to build it! Download Sonic Pi and Processing now and get the source code and instructions from Mehackit Github page: <a href="https://github.com/mehackit/technomachine">https://github.com/mehackit/technomachine</a>

I did the programming and GUI design of Techno Machine in Processing and Sonic Pi.
