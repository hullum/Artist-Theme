Kitkaliitto makes lush electronic music with an adventurous mindset. 
The guys work in their secret basement studio and, every now and then, surface to the real world. 

Supersonic is an adrenaline-charged, music-driven 3D ride game. The players blaze through radiant neon racing circuits at ever faster speeds, accompanied by electronic beats from Finnish artist collective Kitkaliitto.
