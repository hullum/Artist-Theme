            Tommi Toivonen (formerly Koskinen), born 1981 in Turku, Finland, is a musician, sound designer and a media artist currently residing in Helsinki, Finland. 
            His background is originally in engineering and computer science (BA), but for the last 10 years he has followed his passion to focus his energy in music, sound design and media art projects. 
            He finished his Sound in New Media MA program studies in Media Lab of Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture in Fall 2015.<br><br>

            Creating sounds and immersive audio experiences for games is what he really loves to do most and has recently started to gravitate more towards game audio projects. Outside his main focus of sound design and music production, the spectrum of his artistic work ranges from sound installations and physical interaction design to experimental electronic music live performances. <br><br>
            
            His works and performances have been shown at Cumulus 2012 Conference in Helsinki, Raflost Festival in Reykjavik, Cabaret Rhizome in Tallinn, Club Transmediale and Universität der Künste in Berlin. He has two bands Phantom and Kitkaliitto and has been playing shows internationally for audiences in Europe and USA. <br><br>
            
            Tommi currently works at <a href="http://www.vildmusic.com">VILD Music</a> as a composer and sound designer. I have previously worked at <a href="http://www.mehackit.org">Mehackit</a>, <a href="http://www.audiodraft.com">Audiodraft</a> and <a href="http://www.kuuasema.com">Kuuasema</a> in positions related to music production, audio design, creative technology and education.</p>
